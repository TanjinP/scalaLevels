# Scala levels: beginner to expert, application programmer to library designer
A look into Scala levels as <a href="http://www.scala-lang.org/old/node/8610" target="_blank">explored by Martin Odersky</a>

Used jupyter notebook to present code and concepts clearly. Please view .ipynb files in desktop mode to see them properly.

In order to run on local you will need to have <a href="http://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html" target="_blank">jupyter notebook</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/alexarchambault/jupyter-scala" target="_blank">scala kernel</a> installed. 
Alternatively you can paste the code directly into the Scala REPL or a Scala worksheet (via IntelliJ or Eclipse with Scala plug-in) to play with. 

Jupyter Notebooks will be added and updated periodically for all levels. 

Please feel free to contribute more examples.
